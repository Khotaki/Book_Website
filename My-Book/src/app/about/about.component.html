      <p class="intro">
        Isis is a visionary storyteller weaving tales of magic, mystery, and the human condition.
      </p>

        <p>
          Born with a love for the fantastical, Isis spent her childhood exploring old libraries and dreaming of worlds beyond the veil. "The Hidden Realm" is her debut novel, born from a vivid dream that wouldn't let her go.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not writing, she can be found hiking through misty forests, brewing excessive amounts of tea, or attempting to converse with neighborhood cats. She believes that magic is real, if you only know where to look.
