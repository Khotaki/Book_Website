      <h2>Book Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Born into one of the most influential houses on the continent, Delayna Valoren is born into one of the most influential houses on the continent, raised to uphold alliances and appearances rather than exercise choice. Her future is decided through political arrangements, and obedience is treated as duty. Beneath the order of noble life, control governs relationships, leaving little space for refusal.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the pressure to conform tightens, Delayna makes a deliberate choice to flee the role assigned to her, abandoning status and protection in pursuit of autonomy. Outside the reach of her family’s power, she must survive without the structures that once defined her, confronting loss, uncertainty, and the consequences of choosing freedom over "safety".
